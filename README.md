AI-POWERED-AUTOMATED-CALLING-AGENT


This system is a fully autonomous, multi-modal AI agent designed to interpret user messages, retrieve contact data, and perform real-world communication actions such as phone calls, emails, and dynamic responses, all orchestrated through n8n.

It operates through two major workflows:

🚀 Workflow 1: AI Command Interpreter (Telegram → OpenAI → Pinecone → Gmail/Twilio/VAPI)

This workflow handles incoming Telegram messages (text or voice), extracts the intent, retrieves contextual data, and executes the required action.

1. Input Processing

Triggered through Telegram Trigger Node.

If the message contains voice, the workflow:

Downloads the audio.

Transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper.

Both text and transcribed voice become normalized input for the AI.

2. Instruction Interpretation (AI Agent)

A custom AI Agent (GPT-4o) performs:

✓ Intent Extraction

“Call John”

“Email Sarah”

“Message the client”

“Get details about Rohit”

✓ Name Extraction

The agent identifies the contact name dynamically.

✓ Action Decision

The agent decides whether to:

Call

Email

Respond

Fetch information

3. Contact Lookup (Pinecone Vector Search)

The extracted name is embedded and looked up in Pinecone to fetch:

Email address

Phone number

Relationship tags

Notes

If no match is found:

“No contact found for [name]”

The workflow stops safely.

4. Executing the Action

Depending on the intent:

📞 Outbound Call

Runs phonecall_someone → triggers secondary VAPI workflow.

Twilio also posts confirmations back to Telegram.

📧 Email

Uses Gmail Tool

Subject, message body, and recipient address are generated by the AI agent.

💬 AI Response

If it’s a simple conversational query, the agent replies directly.

5. Final Output to Telegram

The workflow sends execution results back to Telegram:

“Calling John…”

“Email sent to Sarah”

“No contact found”

“Here’s the information you requested…”

⚙ Workflow 2: Phone-Call Executor (VAPI Call Automation Workflow)

This workflow is triggered internally when the AI selects “call someone”.

1. Call Initialization

Triggered by “Execute Workflow Trigger”

Validates phone number format.

Sends a POST request to https://api.vapi.ai/call/ with:

Assistant ID

User details (first_name, relationship type)

Instructions

Customer phone number

2. Call Status Polling

Uses repeated GET requests to check the call state.

Waits until the call ends.

3. Final Call Summary

Extracts analysis.summary from VAPI response.

Returns a structured “response” to the calling workflow.
